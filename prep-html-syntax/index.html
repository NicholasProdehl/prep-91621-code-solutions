<h1 style="color: mediumturquoise;"> favorite Star Wars character is Yoda.</h1>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/d/d6/Yoda_SWSB.png/revision/latest?cb=20150206140125" alt="This is Yoda." style="width: 300px; height: 400px;">
<p1 style="color: navajowhite;">I honestly haven't watched all of Star Wars all the way through, so I've never met Yoda.
This doesn't mean that I don't think he's really cool for the monk mentality he contributes. </p1>
